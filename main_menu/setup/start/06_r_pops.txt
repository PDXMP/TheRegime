#extra documentation and notes file for changes to 06_pops.txt (WIP)

#conjured pops from new buildings or other ways of increasing the cap appear to always be of the nations culture and religion
#the listed caps per pop type do not match the information paradox provides
#the listed pops for burghers, clerics, nobles arent relevant seemingly unless theyre not of main culture and religion
#the listed pops for peasants matter in that an RGO will only fill up (for free) to the amount of peasants enumerated
#sometimes(?) promotion and/or migration numbers take effect on the starting numbers 
#for unclear reasons at present, changes in pops caused by the new buildings cannot be directly subtracted from the correct peasant category to arrive at the original pop count
#		for more precise information see the #Regime changes in the pops file for Amsterdam, Stuttgart, and Cassel
